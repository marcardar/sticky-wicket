  2) About the game
 
   'Sticky Wicket' is the ultimate cricket game for the P.C. It combines
   the art of captaincy with week to week action of playing. Your
   objective is to win the league and 'Sticky' cup. Your predecessor has
   left, despondent with the teams poor run of recent results. By selecting
   the team, choosing field placings, who bowls the crucial overs, where
   everyone bats and even when a player must run you aim to return the team
   to its former glory. Your success at doing so will be compared to the
   greats  e.g W.G Grace , M.Brearly in the hall of fame. Hence the term
   'Sticky Wicket' hence the situaton you face where winning is the difference
   between glory AND Failure!

  6) Starting up

   To start 'Sticky Wicket' type 'SW' at the DOS prompt.
   All newcomers to the game should input their name and press 'enter'. Then
   using the 'up' and 'down' cursor keys change the highlighted team to the
   one that you wish to control and press 'space bar'. If you wish to continue
   from where you left off in a previous season press 'enter' key without
   inputting your name.


  7) The Game - 'Sticky Wicket'

  i)  Menu
   By pressing any number from 1-8 you will be able to access the option you
   want. The fixture list and league table are self-explanatory , press any key
   to return to the menu. If you wish to view career or seasonal averages use
   the cursor keys and press 'enter' to select the team that is highlighted.
   The batting averages for the top 16 players are shown. By pressing any key
   the bowling averages are shown. Any player that has not played (ie batted or
   bowled) is not shown. This is why the seasonal averages cannot be accessed
   until at least one game has been played. Scores in the 'Sticky Cup' are
   not included in the seasonal averages. To return to the menu just select
   End Viewing Averages and press space.


  ii) Team selection
  
    Naturally for those who wish to get 'stuck in' the first 11 players will be
    automatically selected. However, you can select eleven of your choice by
    pressing 2 in the main menu. The criteria for selection is that you can
    only have 1 wicket keeper, 5 bowlers and 5 other players. Until this is
    achieved you will be unable to return to the main menu by pressing 'e'.

    Wicket Keepers - There are 2 wicket keepers per team. One must play in
    that role but there is nothing to stop you playing the other as a
    batsman. To select, use the highlight bar to move to the player by using
    the cursor keys and press 'w'. The player name should become green.

    Bowlers - There are approx. 8 bowlers per team. To select use the
    highlight to move to the player and press 'b'. The computer will not allow
    a bowler with 0 (Zero) Bowling ability to be selected.

    Batsmen - Use highlight bar as above and press 'o' to select any player
    for the sole purpose of batting.
  
    The following qualities (On a scale of zero to ten) act as a guide to
    which players should be selected and gives a brief statement of their
    preferred positions.

    Fitness - This declines rapidly for bowlers, less so for batsmen. To
    counter this you should make regular alterations to the side enabling the
    players to recouperate. Over-use of players makes them become stale and
    will affect their performance (ie a player of 1 (one) fitness is useless.)

    Ability - This changes from season to season unlike fitness which varies
    every game. It is determined by the player's personnal success over the
    season. Bowling and Batting figures are given. The higher the value the
    more likely he is to be successful when wielding the bat or bowling,
    fitness permitting.

    Form - This changes from match to match and is an indication of the players
    current form. High values will mean he is very confident and has been
    successful with the bat or ball. A loss in form may result in poor
    performances.


   iii) Playing 'Sticky Wicket'

    Pressing '1' in the main menu will take you to the next match.
    The opposition and your teams strengths and weaknesses are compared. If
    your fitness is significantly low the likelyhood of catches being dropped ,
    fielder mistakes and a general lethargic performance overall are increased.
    Alterations should be made when you next retun to the main menu.
    A coin is tossed and the opposition will inform you of its intention to bat
    or field. If it wins, press 'space' to continue. If you win use 'b' to bat
    or 'f' to field.


   iv) If you elect or are put into bat
  
    Select your two openers. They should be chosen to see off the new ball to
    enable the middle order to hit out. Openers are specialist batsmen and by
    looking at player qualities when choosing the team you can see which
    normally do the job. Enter the batsman number and press return.
    Edited Highlights will be displayed.... Make sure your finger is poised
    over the 'r' button. If the ball doesn't cross the boundary as a 4 or 6 it
    will be fielded by the opposition. By pressing 'r' will enable your batsmen
    to run, you must decide if it is safe to do so. Failure to keep the score-
    board ticking over by taking quick runs will reduce the overall team
    score. However, run outs can be equally disasterous. Even if you are
    outside the crease there is still a possibility that the opposition fielder
    will miss the stumps. If a decision is close the umpire will be called
    upon to adjudicate. Unfortunately this is open to human error and may be
    dubious, but that's cricket!


   v) If you elect to field or are put into field
  
    Utilising your bowlers to the optinum performance is an acquired skill.
    With practise you will discover which can conserve runs and which will take
    wickets. When in the scorecard (ie at fall of Wicket or at the end of each
    over) by pressing 'f' you will be able to select from five fields -
    orthodox, defensive, attacking, highly attacking and unorthodox, each with
    their own merits. The first 10 overs with the new ball and the last are
    the most critical. Bowlers are restricted to 8 overs, none of which can be
    bowled consecutively. If you are unable to select a particular bowler,
    or the computer automatically selects someone else, this is to enable the
    above rules for bowling to apply. This can be remedied by trying another
    bowler who hasn't completed his spell.

    The result of your match will be displayed as will any other results in
    the week (including high scores and best bowling figures). After seven
    league matches the final table will be shown. If you fail to achieve a
    high placing you can remedy this by winning the Quarter-final match for
    The 'Sticky Wicket' cup and hopefully progress on to the final. On
    completion of the cup you can have one final glance at the averages. All
    league and cup wins are recorded for posterity under career records in
    the menu, as are the successes of your nearest rivals in the Hall of Fame.
    Will you climb to the heights of W.G Grace ?

 
  8) Changing the speed

   The speed at which the game runs should be the same for both fast and slow
   PC's. However, if you find the actual game is not running at the correct
   speed, you should try typing the following at the DOS prompt when you next
   RUN 'Sticky Wicket':

                    SW X  (Where X is a whole number from 1 to 300)

   As a rough guide, a 286-12 machine should run perfectly using

                    SW 14     to begin the program.  

   You may have to play around with finding the best value for your P.C. 


  9) Information on changing team and player names

   If you decide that you want to change some of the names you can easily
   change the data files using a text editor. However, if you do this you must
   make sure that you have backed up this program in case anything goes wrong.
